<h2>About GW ScholarSpace</h2>
<p>GW ScholarSpace is a repository for scholarly works at the George Washington University. It provides free, public access, broad visibility, and long-term preservation for scholarly works created by GW’s faculty, staff, and students, including Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs).</p>
<p>GW ScholarSpace runs on software developed by the GW Libraries <a href="https://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology">Scholarly Technology Group</a>. GW ScholarSpace is a <a href="https://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology">Ruby on Rails</a> based application that layers on top of <a href="http://sufia.io/">Sufia</a>, a <a href="http://projecthydra.org/">Hydra</a> application that incorporates features from <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a> and many other widely-used components. The repository's content and metadata is stored in a Fedora repository; <a href="http://sufia.io/">Fedora</a> is widely used, trusted, open-source repository software. GW ScholarSpace runs on GW and <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Washington Research Library Consortium</a> infrastructure.  All of the code for GW ScholarSpace (as well as Sufia) is open source and can be viewed in <a href="https://github.com/gwu-libraries/scholarspace-sufia7">GitHub</a>. GW ScholarSpace is under active development and users will benefit from new features and new integrations as they become available.</p>
<h2>Using GW ScholarSpace to Participate in GW's Open Access Resolution</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://library.gwu.edu/about/faculty-open-access">Open Access Resolution</a> applies to GW faculty scholarly works. It automatically gives GW a non-exclusive right to distribute designated GW scholarly works, unless an opt-out waiver has been signed (see Opting Out). When signing publishing agreements for the publication of an article, the author(s) should let the publisher know that the agreement is subject to prior license agreement with The George Washington University. The Author's Addendum can be found at Open Access at GW.</p>
<p> As soon as an article is published, you will be able to upload a copy directly into the GW ScholarSpace repository. Currently, you can submit your work through our Deposit Form and the Library will notify you when the work has been uploaded.</p>
<p> The Open Access Resolution does not apply to theses or dissertations.</p>
<h2>Preservation</h2>
<p>GW Libraries are committed to providing long-term access to all works submitted to GW ScholarSpace. Adhering to best practices, GW ScholarSpace and GW Libraries staff use digital preservation strategies that adapt to the changing technological environment.</p>
<p>All work submitted to GW ScholarSpace will be preserved at a basic bit-level. The characteristics of a work (such as format, mime type, date created) will be captured and stored as metadata during the deposit process to mitigate potential format obsolescence. All works deposited will receive a SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) checksum, which is used to document file integrity over time. Regular file integrity checks will be performed to check for changes (such as file corruption), and can even be scheduled on-demand.</p>
<p> Certain file formats (such as openly-documented, non-proprietary, lossless) are more easily preserved than others. To better assist contributors, please refer to the table below, which details recommended preservation file formats.</p>
<h2 id="preservation-formats">Recommended Preservation Formats</h2>
<p>Works using recommended preservation formats benefit from format longevity, acceptance and use in professional communities, long term accessibility of most viewing software, and incorporated metadata.</p>
<p>The formats recommended below are recommended by the information technology, archival, and records management professional communities.</p>

<h2>Withdrawal</h2>
<p>Works submitted to GW ScholarSpace are permanent.

To avoid loss of the historical record, all such instances will be documented via a statement attached to the record in PDF. The content of the document should be: <em>"This work has been withdrawn from GW ScholarSpace. If you have questions, please contact __________."</em></p>
